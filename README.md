Instructions for printing bulk paper wallets:

Select Paper Wallet from the tabs above. The default values will be 2 addresses to generate, and 2 addresses per page.
2 addresses per page is perfect for LANDSCAPE orientation. Before you change these values, try these defaults.

- Click "Print"

- Choose the landscape orientation

- Choose "scale to page"

- Choose "flip on short edge"

- Choose Print

Hold the result up to the light to check the alignement. The backs are larger than the fronts so that there is a
high tolerance for misalignement. As long as the entire front fits within the borders of the backing, you should be good.

For smaller wallets you can use PORTRAIT orientation. I have found that setting 4 addresses per page seems to work quite well.

See below for issues.

Found and fixed a (really sloppy) bug where the title was being printed, and pushing off the alignment of the first two pages. Sorry about that.

This is the first release of the DEFCOIN bulk paper wallet generator. It is based on the the most excellent CryptoLife Universal Paper Wallet Generator.

For this early release, I concentrated on the "Paper Wallet" tab. I tested it in Chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu as I don't currently have access to other systems to test. If you have any problems with other systems, let me know via twitter @allansto.

Known Issues:

- The "Hide Art?" function does not work. (If you want this function, why are you looking for a bulk paper wallet generator?)

- The "Brain Wallet" tab remains untested, but I suspect that it is not working correctly. Proceed with caution.

- There is no way to turn off the "backings". If you do not have a printer that automatically prints both sides, I suggest that you print to a PDF, and then open that file and print all odd pages first, flip the pages back into your printer's hopper, then print all even pages. (don't forget to destry the file when you are done)
